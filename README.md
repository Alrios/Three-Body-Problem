# Motion of a Satellite using the Two Body Problem 

This small simulation consists in predicting the motion of a Satellite, which is influenced by the gravity of the Moon and Earth. The programming language used is Python and the libraries used   are Pandas and Scipy.

### Definitions and Physics

**The Two Body Problem** consists in predicting the motion of two celestial bodies, which only interact with each other without the influence of a third body. In general, this kind of problem is known as " **the n-Body Problem**".  First is important to calculate the motion of the Moon and the Earth.

Is commonly known that the Earth orbits around the Sun, but actually the Earth and Sun orbit around his common **center of mass**, this center of mass is called **barycenter**. This not only applies for the system Earth-Sun, it applies for all celestial bodies. That means, the Earth and Moon have they own **barycenter**.
