# Motion of a Satellite using the Two Body Problem 

This small simulation consists in predicting the motion of a Satellite, which is influenced by the gravity of the Moon and Earth. The programming language used is Python and the libraries used   are Pandas and Scipy.

### Definitions and Physics

**The Two Body Problem** consists in predicting the motion of two celestial bodies, which only interact with each other without the influence of a third body. In general, this kind of problem is known as " **the n-Body Problem**".  First is important to calculate the motion of the Moon and the Earth.

Is commonly known that the Earth orbits around the Sun, but actually the Earth and Sun orbit around his common **center of mass**, this center of mass is called **barycenter**. This not only applies for the system Earth-Sun, it applies for all celestial bodies. That means, the Earth and Moon have they own **barycenter**. 

Let the orbit of the Earth be **1** and Moon **2**. The semi-major axis of the Orbit 1<a><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?r_1"/></a>  is actually the distance to the barycenter and <a><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?r_2"/></a> is the semi-major axis of the Orbit 2 and the distance to the barycenter. If <a><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?r_1"/></a> and <a><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?r_2"/></a> are the distances to the barycenter, that means the sum of both is the distance from the Earth and Moon,  in other words <a><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?a = r_1+r_2"/></a>, where <a><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?a"/></a> and <a><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?a"/></a>is the semi-major axis of the whole system.
